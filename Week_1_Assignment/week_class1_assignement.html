Week 1 Class 1 Assignment

From the questions below, you are required to answer all questions.
Make sure all of your code is arranged properly and cleanly.  This is comparable to a test so I will NOT be giving very much help if any. 

For this first assignment you will have the github repository (introduction to HTML5 and CSS) to use for help, so it will be your main tool.

NOTE
1. For each excersie ensure you have <html></html> 
2. All excercises should be done in a new html page 
3. All excercises should be saved in their respective excerise name 
4. All excerices should be committed to each student repository and Week_1_Assignment folder in the main class repository with the name of student as the file_name.
